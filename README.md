# Precision FDM

This guide is intended to get a consumer FDM printer to a state where it'll print mechanically accurate functional parts. There is still some benefit to calibration for non-functional parts as it will improve aesthetics. This guide assumes that you're willing to make an investment in metrology equipment (see [Required items](#required-items)).

Attempting to use any kind of whole system calibration that depends on taking measurements from a printed part and using a spreadsheet & statistics to get steps/mm and/or CTE values does not work well because there are simply too many unknown variables. 
The best way to calibrate is to break it down into direct measurements and minimise the number of unknowns.

#### [Per filament](#per-filament-1)

* [Coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE)](#coefficient-of-thermal-expansion)

### Variables not calibrated in this guide

### Required items
* Digital vernier caliper
  * Good: 150mm digital vernier caliper (Any cheap brand or Mitutoyo 500-184-30)
  * Best: 300mm digital vernier caliper (Mitutoyo 500-173)
* Digital micrometer
  * Good: 0-25mm [0-1"] (Any cheap brand)
  * Best: 0-25mm [0-1"] (Mitutoyo 293-832)
* Fine permanent marker
* Good quality PLA filament


## Per Printer
### XYZ steps/mm 
#### Procedure
Using a digital vernier caliper, mount it to the printer in a way that means movements on the axis of interest pushes the caliper head.

Start from a zero position, zero the caliper, and send the g-code command to move a good amount (100mm) then take a reading from the caliper. 

Repeat this 3 times and calculate an average. 

Use this value to calculate new steps-per-mm.

#### Example
```
Expected reading = 100.00mm
Averaged actual reading = 98.60mm
Printer steps-per-mm on axis = 80

Expected/Averaged actual = Scale
100.00/98.60 = 1.01419878296146

Printer current steps-per-mm * Scale = New steps-per-mm
80 * 1.01419878296146 = 81.136
```

#### Saving value to printer

(Substitute 'X' for 'Y'/'Z' when appropriate)
```
M92 X81.136
M500
M501
```
`M501` will show you that the value has been committed.

### Extruder steps/mm
#### Procedure

Ensure extruder tension is low so that there aren't huge tooth marks on the filament.

Remove bowden tube from extruder and ensure there's an approx. 25mm tail of filament sticking out. 

Make a mark on the filament with the permanent marker right at the point where it comes out the bowden fitting. 

Send the g-code command to move a good amount (150mm for small caliper, 300mm for large caliper). 

Make another mark on the filament, extrude 25mm and cut it off. 

Measure distance between markings with vernier.

Use this value to calculate new steps-per-mm.

TO DO: Add alternate procedure using snips instead of permanent marker.

## Per Filament

### Nominal diameter

Check the nominal diameter using the digital micrometer. You're looking for a small spread of values around 1.75mm (or 3.00mm). If values are wildly varying, return filament for refund.

### Extrusion Flow

#### Assumptions
* Printer has 0.4mm nozzle.
* CTE is small enough to not introduce a large error (true for PLA).

#### Procedure
Use the single wall box test at the recommended temps for the filament. 

Ensure the slicer has 1 wall with a width of 0.5mm, and 2 base layers. 

Print part, then wait for it to cool to room temperature. 

Take a series of wall thickness measurements with the digital micrometer and compute an average. 

Use this value to calculate the filament specific flow rate.

#### Example
````
Expected wall thickness = 0.500mm
Average wall thickness = 0.537mm

(Expected/Averaged actual)*100 = Flow rate %
(0.500/0.537)*100 = 93.1%

### Coefficient of thermal expansion

To do a CTE calibration assumes that _all other_ calibrations has been performed otherwise it isn't possible to get accurate results. 

Note that various brands of pure PLA (not modified PLA like PLA+ etc.) has a very small range of CTE (around 68µm/m-°C) that results in a scale factor of approximately 100.27%. We can utilise this useful property of PLA to gain confidence in the overall calibration and the application of the CTE calibration procedure if we use PLA in this calibration and subsequently find the scale factor to be 100.27%.

### Linear advance

After doing all the other calibrations, you may find gaps in your print. This is where the pressure inside the nozzle is not high enough at the beginning of a move. This is covered in detail [here](http://marlinfw.org/docs/features/lin_advance.html).
